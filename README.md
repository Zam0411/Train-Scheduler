# Train-Scheduler

A combination of Bootstrap, Moment.js, Jquery and Firebase were used in order to build this app.
When updating information using form input validation firebase is updated keeping the train schedule information to stay up to date 
no matter who pulls up the site. Moment.js was heavily used in order to keep the time to be properly updated when a new or existing 
train schedule has reached it's scheduled time.
